## About

An easy-to-set-up Bash prompt with a lovely little easy-to-read Git status output (for dummies like me) and some fancy schmancy Font Awesomeness icons to give it that extra juicy look. Can't be coding in ugliness, now can we?

## Install

**1.** Run the `setup.sh` script inside the `hyper-cli-bash-config/` folder.
```bash
./setup.sh
```

**2.** Install the `FontAwesome` stack.


## Hyper CLI

**Hyper CLI** download link [here](https://hyper.is/).

**Material Theme** greatness [here](https://hyper.is/themes).

Everything else needed should be included, except for the Operator Mono font (which you'll have to procure yourself, if you want to use that font). Otherwise change the font in the `.hyper.js` settings to whatever font you like, but leave the Font Awesomeness unchanged. 

## FontAwesome

**FontAwesome 4** download link [here](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/assets/font-awesome-4.7.0.zip).

**FontAwesome 5** download link [here](https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.3/fontawesome-free-5.6.3-desktop.zip).

## Got it? Git it? Good

The rest should probably, and hopefully be pretty self-explanatory, I think. Please don't goddam *troll* me if it isn't. Google is your friend, but I am not.

Good luck, and may the Source be with you.
